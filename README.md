This is a simple program to create a basic (not compound) proposition truth table, based on the input # of propositions ($2^n$).
MacOs Instructions:
1). clone repo by running `git clone https://github.com/danielsilva010/discrete-math.git` on your terminal.
2). add alias to your ~/.zshrc file, by running `vi ~/.zshrc` and at the top of the file inserting the following `alias ttg="cd ~/path/to/cloned/repo && java truthTable"` and replace "/path/to/cloned/repo" with your path to the cloned repo, then do `source ~/.zshrc`.
3). with all installations done, run the script at any time by entering `ttg` into the terminal.
